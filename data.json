I then designed a simple book icon which helped users quickly understand the functionality of the app.<br/><br/>In addition to these changes, I iteratively refined other design elements such as the layout of the tuition page where the tutors name and image was displayed. Further addition of a video which portrays success story of the institution helped build trust with the customers.<br/><br/>Each iteration was made by user feedback, with the goal of making the app more user-friendly, visually appealing, and effective at helping users choose the best tutors easily.<br/><br/>By using an iterative design process, I was able to make incremental improvements to the app over time, leading to a final design that effectively met the needs and preferences of our users.",

Generally parents send their kids in the cab as what the school provides or where the kids schoolmates opt to. There seems to be no other way for the parents to find cabs for their kids. In order to fulfill this need I thought of creating an application that bridges the gap between parents and the cab drivers while ensuring a safe journey for kids. The goal is to create an easy-to-use and secure transportation application for an upcoming company called KidCabs, which caters to children in India's Tier 1 cities. The challenge is to ensure that children are safe in the cab, are readily picked up, and arrive at their destination while giving parents complete control and peace of mind."

My thought process was to design a parents app using which users can book cabs, allow access to their children, set custom alerts like geofencing, loud noise, overspeeding, route deviation. They can also select the favourite locations for their kids so that their kida can book cabs only to and from those locations.

So I decided to keep the favourites location icon in the same place even after the users click on it.<br/><br/>Another area I iteratively improved upon was to add a separate confirmation, payments page so that the users donot book cabs at fault. Adding parental controls in the app ensures that the kids donot book cabs by themselves and go by their own wish. Parents need to verify each and every trip a kid books without which a trip is not confirmed. This adds an extra layer of safety, awareness to kids and parents.<br/><br/>In addition to these changes, I received feedback from the users of the kids app that selecting dates was confusing. So I brought in the thought of the good old calendar which the kids will be aware of instead of the shorter and cleaner calendar UI that I designed for the adults. Further addition of 16-step verification feature and our safety precautions like geofencing, emergency SOS, cameras helps to build trust with the customers.<br/><br/>Each iteration was made by user feedback, with the goal of making the app more user-friendly, visually appealing, and effective at helping users book the cabs easily.<br/><br/>By using an iterative design process, I was able to make incremental improvements to the app over time, leading to a final design that effectively met the needs and preferences of our users."
